An Interactive CLI for Nightwatch.

## Warning

This project was hacked together. I may tidy it up and write some tests for it in the future. If you have any issues, feel free to make an issue for it so I know if people are interested in using it.

npm install -g night-patrol
```

## Usage

To start a Night Patrol session, run:
